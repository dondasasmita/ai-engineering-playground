        "body" : "The Ministry of Education (MOE) has terminated its contract with device management app Mobile Guardian, which suffered two major cybersecurity breaches earlier this year, a source within the ministry told CNA.  MOE is looking at other options, the source added.In response to CNA's queries, MOE said the matter will be addressed this week. Mobile Guardian did not respond to queries. The most recent breach on Aug 4 affected about 13,000 users from 26 secondary schools in Singapore. Students had their personal learning devices wiped remotely by hackers and could not access their apps and information stored in them - including lesson notes and practice papers.  At the time, many of them were worried about losing access to their notes with the exams looming.  The day after the incident, MOE said it would remove the Mobile Guardian app from all students' iPads and Chromebooks as a precaution.  Given that the app allows parents to manage students’ device usage by restricting applications or websites and screen time, a guide was issued to parents detailing how parental controls could be set up even without the app.  ISSUE TO BE RAISED IN PARLIAMENT The incident in August followed a major data leak in April, where information of parents and staff from 127 schools were compromised. ",

        "body" : "Are taxis in a death spiral as an essential transport service in Singapore? Recently, my wife was at the One Holland Village mall looking for a taxi. After waiting at the mall for some time, she finally got a taxi on the Comfort app. No point waiting at the taxi stand, the driver told her laughingly, there would be no taxis. The demand for and supply of taxi rides depend on each other in a self-fulfilling way. Taxi drivers go to taxi stands expecting customers, and customers go to taxi stands expecting taxis. However, as my wife’s experience illustrates, the cycle can work in the opposite direction. If taxi drivers do not expect passengers at a taxi stand, they will not waste time queuing there. If customers do not expect taxis at a stand, they will not go there. The same goes for the whole industry: The more it contracts, the more it would tend to continue contracting – hence my speculation of a death spiral. But would it really be conceivable for Singapore to have no taxis in the future? DUAL CHALLENGE If the only way to get a taxi is through an app, taxi services would be just one tap away from ride-hail services. From the customer viewpoint, taxis would lose the competitive advantage of immediate, convenient availability on the street without any booking. Side-by-side on the phone (even on the same app), the competition boils down to how quickly we can get a ride and how much it costs. It may be challenging for taxis on both counts. Availability is a challenge as the pool of taxis dwindles. Over the last 10 years, between 2014 and 2023, the number of taxis fell by more than half from over 28,700 to 13,300. It is no coincidence that, during that same period, the number of private hire cars exploded from 1,600 to 53,400 as Uber, then Grab followed by Gojek entered the Singapore market. Moreover, taxi fares seem to keep going up. In December 2023, taxi operators introduced a new weekend peak-hour surcharge and extended the daily evening peak surcharge by one hour. Comfort DelGro, the largest taxi operator, also increased its flagdown fare and distance-based rates for metered rides.",

        "body": "Over the years, they have travelled together, eaten together and on some occasions, bunked together. It is a bond extending beyond that of just a typical coach and athlete. And while Yurnita Omar has four children of her own, her boccia apprentice Jeralyn Tan is just as much kin. \"We're not just like friends, we're like family,\" Yurnita told CNA. \"She can tell me everything - from boccia, to her family, to her feelings. Everything. \"From one look on her face, I know what she is going through ... that's how close we are.\" On Monday (Sep 2), Tan clinched a historic boccia silver at the Paris Paralympics. This was Singapore's very first medal in the sport.The 35-year-old, who has cerebral palsy, became Singapore's fourth Paralympic medallist, joining swimmers Yip Pin Xiu and Theresa Goh as well as equestrienne Laurentia Tan in the history books. Because Tan's BC1 class allows her to receive assistance, Yurnita acts as not only her coach but also as her assistant or competition partner during matches.",

        "body": "What do you think of when you read the words “urban resilience”? Perhaps you might visualise images of bricks and concrete, or even security features such as concrete barriers and bollards. You would be right - and wrong at the same time. These are undoubtedly important in ensuring a city’s ability to withstand physical shocks, but true urban resilience is at its core a state of mind. It reflects how we respond to existential threats and how we deal with broader uncertainty.  Singapore has historically performed well when it comes to resilience surveys.    In March, it was ranked the world’s sixth most resilient city in real estate consultancy Savills’ annual global index. The index tracked the resilience of 490 cities, measuring the strength of their economies against several key areas, including their technological base and attractiveness for real estate investors. In a recent Global Resilience Index by insurance firm FM Global, Singapore was ranked third most resilient in the world, bolstered by its strengths in logistics, urbanisation, political risk and productivity. These results should come as no surprise to even the most casual of observers.",
