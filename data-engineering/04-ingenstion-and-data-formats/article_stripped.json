    "body": " COPENHAGEN: As Europe grapples with a large number of immigrants, some countries are looking to Denmark to find a solution.\r\n\r\nDespite a coalition government led by a centre-left party - typically considered open to immigrants - Denmark has some of the most restrictive immigration policies in the European Union.\r\n\r\nOn average, around 85,000 immigrate to Denmark in a year. In comparison, Germany, which receives the highest number of asylum applications in the bloc, saw a net migration of between 680,000 and 710,000 people last year. &nbsp;\r\n\r\nAs Danish immigration policies have become stricter, so have the laws \u2013 those who start a new life in the nation must blend into society or risk being sent home.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe need to assimilate is a requirement rather than a choice for those granted permission to stay.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nImmigrants applying for citizenship have to go through language tests and live in spaces demarcated for immigrants.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAmong those who have taken the leap of faith is Ahmad, who arrived in Denmark from Iran nine years ago, with almost zero knowledge about the country.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWith the help of Copenhagen charity Netv\u00e6rkshuset, which means \u201cthe network house\u201d in English, he restarted his life.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe need to start from (the) beginning. Everything \u2013 &nbsp;life, language, friends, maybe family,\u201d he told CNA.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe charity has almost 200 clients of all ages from all over the world.\r\n\r\nCo-ordinator at Netv\u00e6rkshuset Melia Koutina Nielsen said that the charity also trains the immigrants on work culture so they can secure a job as quickly as possible, which can be a challenge.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\u201cWe \u2026 try and support them with a link to the labour market,\u201d she said.&nbsp;\r\n \u201cPARALLEL SOCIETIES\u201d\r\n\r\nThere are currently 12 areas across the country, where immigrants from non-Western countries and their descendants make up more than 50 per cent of the population.\r\n\r\nThey are now officially known as \u201cparallel societies\u201d after the previous term \u201cghetto\u201d was dropped over concerns it was derogatory.\r\n\r\nBut while the name has changed, the government\u2019s goal remains the same - for such homes to be gone. Denmark passed a controversial law in 2018 to redevelop poor urban housing areas with high concentrations of immigrant populations by 2030.\r\n\r\nWith up to 11,000 social housing tenants potentially having to leave their homes, critics have argued it disrupts families and communities.\r\n\r\nWhen CNA approached the Danish government and the Ministry of Immigration for interviews, they declined to comment.\r\n\r\nThe previous Danish government had plans to house up to 125 rejected asylum seekers on an uninhabited island south of the capital, but the idea was dropped due to concerns over cost.\r\n EFFORTS TO REDUCE MIGRATION\r\n\r\nDenmark is now leading a group of 15 EU member states calling for new ideas and solutions to lower migration to Europe.\r\n\r\nAmong the ideas they have put forward in an open letter are stronger border measures, speeding up the process of removing migrants and partnerships with third countries if migrants cannot be sent back to their home countries.\r\n\r\nThis comes on top of a landmark reform of the bloc's asylum system passed by lawmakers to reduce irregular migration following years of debate. The new rules are set to take effect in 2026.\r\n\r\nHowever, asylum director at the Danish Refugee Council Eva Singer, who has seen a gradual tightening of immigration laws in her home country, fears the potential impact of other nations following suit.\r\n\r\nShe noted that if other countries tried as hard as Denmark to scare people away, this would make an already difficult situation worse for asylum seekers.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\u201cI fear that it would just mean that the refugees would have to move from country to country until they are able to get the protection that they are actually entitled to,\u201d she said.&nbsp;\r\n",
